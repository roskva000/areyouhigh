## 2024-05-22 - [Missing Security Headers in Vercel Deployment]
**Vulnerability:** The application was deployed to Vercel without standard security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Referrer-Policy`. This made the app susceptible to clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, and other web-based attacks.
**Learning:** Vercel does not inject these essential security headers by default. They must be explicitly configured in the deployment configuration file.
**Prevention:** Always verify and include a robust `headers` configuration block in `vercel.json` for all routes (`/(.*)`) to ensure fundamental HTTP security headers are enforced.
