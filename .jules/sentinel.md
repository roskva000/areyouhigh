**Status:** Initialized Sentinel journal.

## 2024-05-22 - [Missing Security Headers in Vercel Deployment]
**Vulnerability:** The application was deployed to Vercel without standard security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Referrer-Policy`. This made the app susceptible to clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, and other web-based attacks.
**Learning:** Vercel does not inject these essential security headers by default. They must be explicitly configured in the deployment configuration file.
**Prevention:** Always verify and include a robust `headers` configuration block in `vercel.json` for all routes (`/(.*)`) to ensure fundamental HTTP security headers are enforced.

## 2024-05-23 - [Missing Rate Limiting & Silent Errors]
**Vulnerability:** Supabase API calls in `useComments.js` and `useVotes.js` lacked state locks (e.g., `isSubmitting`, `isVoting`), allowing potential API spam and race conditions. Furthermore, error objects from Supabase were silently ignored or logged to the console, exposing sensitive inner structures.
**Learning:** React hooks interacting with external APIs (like Supabase) must explicitly handle loading states to prevent rapid, duplicate submissions. Additionally, external library errors must be explicitly checked and thrown, then caught securely without exposing internal data structures to the client.
**Prevention:** Always implement `isSubmitting`/`isVoting` locks when writing interactive API hooks. Always wrap Supabase calls in `try/catch/finally` blocks, explicitly check for the `error` property in the response, and log securely in the `catch` block.
## 2024-05-15 - [Information Exposure in Client Logs]
**Vulnerability:** Logging raw database error objects (from Supabase) to the browser console.
**Learning:** Supabase `error` objects can contain database constraints, table names, or internal state. Exposing them in client-side logs creates an information leakage risk.
**Prevention:** Always catch and sanitize API/Database errors before logging them in client-side code; fail securely with generic error messages.

## 2024-05-18 - Unhandled Supabase Promise Rejections
**Vulnerability:** Supabase queries were missing `try/catch` blocks and explicitly throwing the raw returned `error` object up the stack, which could expose internal database information or unhandled promise rejection details to the client in production.
**Learning:** In a production application, raw database errors and stack traces should never be exposed to the client. Unhandled promise rejections can also cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.
**Prevention:** Always wrap Supabase database queries in `try/catch` blocks, explicitly check for the returned `error` object, and log the error safely (e.g., only in dev mode) without throwing it to the client. Also, use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()` when querying for a row that might not exist to prevent throwing a PGRST116 error.
